1. **_A JavaScript framework?_** 🥱🫡
2. **_A JavaScript library?_** 😁📚

> **ANSWER:** It's absolutely crucial that if you ever hear anyone have the audacity to call it a framework,

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
