# About React

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ npm run dev
```

```
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm start
$ pnpm run dev
```

> **ANSWER:** It's absolutely crucial that if you ever hear anyone have the audacity to call it a framework,
> you must correct them as pedantically as possible, preferably starting your response with the phrase "um, actually..." ü´°üòÅ
