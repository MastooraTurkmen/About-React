Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

```
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm start
```

> you must correct them as pedantically as possible, preferably starting your response with the phrase "um, actually..." 🫡😁
